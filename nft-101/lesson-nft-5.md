# Setting Up Our NFT Minter DAPP



The react dapp for the boiler plate of our lesson can be found [here](https://github.com/CadenaDev/cadena_nft_minter_template).

Note: IPFS can be slow at times so if you don't see your images load, it can take sometime. You can also experiment with using the Cloudflare IPFS gate way, found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/ipfs-gateway/).

1. Get your contract address and update it in the contract address variable in the boiler plate.

```javascript
const contractAddress = 'INSERT_YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE';
```



2. Copy your compiled smartcontract ABI file from hardhat over to the contracts folder in the react app and update the **abi** variable to reflect accordingly. 

```javascript
import abi from "./contracts/CadenaNFTS.json";
```

3. Copy over the CID (content id) of your metadata folder on Pinata and update the **metadataURI** variable.

```javascript
const metadataURI = `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/INSERT_YOUR_JSON_CID_HERE/${tokenId}.json`
```

4. Copy over the contents of your **_metadata.json** from  hashlibs, located in the **build/json** folder into **nft_metadata.json**

### Viewing your Minted NFTs 

You can see if your NFT's have been minted by viewing them on the Alchemy Goerli or OpenSea testnets. To do so simply take your smart contract address and paste it in the search bar.
